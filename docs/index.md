# Learning

This site is meant to collect information that's immediately relevant to people who want to start learning the KD speedrun.

## General

- VSync introduces a significant amount of input lag, so it's highly recommended to turn it off.
  - To change the VSync setting, interact with the bird on the overworld and press the "Display Settings" hotkey on the bottom of the screen.
- The [practice mod](https://github.com/misoelegant/rpm/tree/master/il-practice-mod) is highly recommended to learn and practice the game.
  - Install the practice mod with the [mod launcher](https://github.com/misoelegant/rpm/tree/master/updater).
  - Feel free to ask questions about the mod (or report bugs) in \#mod-discussion on the discord server.
- The [RTA mod](https://github.com/misoelegant/rpm/tree/master/rta-mod) is recommended for full-game runs because of its standardized, built-in A-button turbo. It includes additional optional QoL features that don't affect the speedrun (e.g. playing as a cousin or displaying level times during the credits).

## Timing

- Any% timing starts when the "start a new game" prompt disappears and ends when 300m is reached in Moon.
- It's recommended to use the [autosplitter](https://www.speedrun.com/katamarireroll/resources) to automatically stop your timer on the correct frame.

## Menuing

- Always use the **second** right trigger (R2 on PS2/PS3, RT on 360, ZR on Switch) on the overworld to fly to Earth between levels.
- Always use **Start** to skip king dialogs during levels. This applies both to the dialog at the start of each level and to the mid-level dialogs that open a new area.
- Mashing **Start** in addition to A slightly speeds up all post-level dialogs (example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNNs2uJ5Bzo)).
- The "press start" dialog at the beginning of the tutorial is bugged and **ignores** most input. The best way to get past it is to mash **both Start and A** until it advances.
  - Higher game FPS is **worse** for advancing the prompt. If you find the prompt consistently difficult to advance, check your FPS and externally cap it to 300 if it's much higher than that.

## Getting ready for your first run

Currently, the easiest first step towards learning the game would be to play along with this no boost run with live commentary found here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/539063804

Your goal for each level should be to be able to play through it from memory a couple of times in a row without getting lost or stuck.

It's probably easiest to learn one level at a time, but mixing up which level you play might be a good idea while you're still trying to memorize the basic routes, to reinforce the levels you haven't played for a while.

For each level, you could try:

- playing along with the video in real time, pausing it when you fall behind.
- watching a chunk of the video that you can remember, pausing it, then playing that part yourself from memory until you catch up to where you paused the video.
- The practice mod currently supports (sort of stable) savestates, which can be helpful to quickly learn the later parts of longer levels. Refer to the practice mod documentation in [resources](./resources.md) for how to use the savestates.

Once you have a good idea of the overall route for each level (or before, since RTA is fun), jump in and get a few PBs under your belt! Feel free to post your times in personal-bests.

After you're comfortable with the route, here's a few things you can try to start optimizing your times further.

- Use other people's PBs on speedrun.com to get a better idea of up-to-date routes that people use in their runs. **The improvement that comes with actively watching other people play and analyzing their decisions can't be overstated.**

- Practicing the longer levels (8, 9, moon) is usually more effective for improving your full game PB compared to the shorter levels.

- If you want to transition from no boost to using boosts, start including easy-looking boosts into your route to get more comfortable with the boost input (mostly when there's not a lot to pick up and you can afford to be a little inaccurate). Boosting is very difficult and it's probably going to suck for a while, but failing a lot is the only way to improve. Every time you do it you're getting a little bit better.

- Use the size bottleneck list in the individual level pages or the spreadsheet in [resources](./resources.md) to help diagnose when you're unexpectedly too small to roll something up. **A big part of optimizing your play is anticipating these bottleneck sizes and making sure you won't be too small for anything coming up.**

- If you feel like you're hitting a wall and can't improve, try a different category or even just take a break for a while. Remember the golden rules of Katamari speedruns: have fun and be yourself!
