Additionally, gameit's no-boost guide.</p> <p>Your goal for each level should be to be able to play through it from memory a couple of times in a row without getting lost or stuck.</p> <p>It's probably easiest to learn one level at a time, but mixing up which level you play might be a good idea while you're still trying to memorize the basic routes, to reinforce the levels you haven't played for a while.</p> <p>For each level, you could try:</p> <ul> <li>playing along with the video in real time, pausing it when you fall behind.</li> <li>watching a chunk of the video that you can remember, pausing it, then playing that part yourself from memory until you catch up to where you paused the video.</li> <li>The practice mod currently supports (sort of stable) savestates, which can be helpful to quickly learn the later parts of longer levels. Refer to the practice mod documentation in resources for how to use the savestates.</li> </ul> <p>Once you have a good idea of the overall route for each level (or before, since RTA is fun), jump in and get a few PBs under your belt! Feel free to post your times in personal-bests.</p> <p>After you're comfortable with the route, here's a few things you can try to start optimizing your times further.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use other people's PBs on speedrun.com to get a better idea of up-to-date routes that people use in their runs. The improvement that comes with actively watching other people play and analyzing their decisions can't be overstated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Practicing the longer levels (8, 9, moon) is usually more effective for improving your full game PB compared to the shorter levels.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you want to transition from no boost to using boosts, start including easy-looking boosts into your route to get more comfortable with the boost input (mostly when there's not a lot to pick up and you can afford to be a little inaccurate). Boosting is very difficult and it's probably going to suck for a while, but failing a lot is the only way to improve. Every time you do it you're getting a little bit better.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the size bottleneck list in the individual level pages or the spreadsheet in resources to help diagnose when you're unexpectedly too small to roll something up. A big part of optimizing your play is anticipating these bottleneck sizes and making sure you won't be too small for anything coming up.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you feel like you're hitting a wall and can't improve, try a different category or even just take a break for a while. Remember the golden rules of Katamari speedruns: have fun and be yourself!</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Cancer/","title":"Make Cancer","text":""},{"location":"Corona%20Borealis/","title":"Make
